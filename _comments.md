# 🗣 Comments
Comments should be kept simple and should be used as often as possible.

```scss
////// Six (6) = H1
//// Four (4) = H2
// Two (2) = single line or comment
// todo: feature request, open tasks etc.

// Can also be a 
// longer explanation

// Just place a shitload of comments to explain what you're doing 💩
```

## Example
```scss
@use '';

////// Component description
//// Important notes if there are any

// Local variables
$padding: ;
$margin: ;

.component { 
    // todo: writing actual code here lol
    ... 
}
```
